The region profiles holds all the available map profiles.
The region profiles have a namespace,
 should indicate the descriptors for the region, the
filenames associated to each region and the colors to be drawn if the region
doesnt have a tile.

Tile size indicates the size of tiles in this region, used for the SSM.
If assigned to undefined then the RegionProfiles.tile_size is used instead.

The region namespace is used for looking into the SSM for the loaded sprites.
This implies that every region will have unique spritesheets as they cant
be shared and must be reloaded.

The region descriptors are useful names as keys and an index as the value.
RegionProfile = {forest: 0, mountain: 1};

The region filenames are an array indicating the spritesheet filename to be
loaded for each region such as
RegionFilenames = ['/spritesheets/forest', undefined];

The region colors indicate what color the 32x32 tile will be. The 32x32 tile is
drawn if the region has no filename.
RegionColors = ['#000000', '#121212'];

Therefore a profile looks like

const RegionProfiles = {
    tile_size: 64,
    ForestDungeon: {
        tile_size: undefined, //Use the default tile_size
        RegionNamespace: "Forest",
        RegionProfile: {forest: 0, mountain: 1},
        RegionFilenames: ['/spritesheets/forest', undefined],
        RegionColors: ['#000000', '#121212']
    }
}

Here the mountain will be colored will the forest will be sprited
