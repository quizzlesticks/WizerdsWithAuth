For now unloading spritesheets isn't supported. There will likely not be enough
sprites to ever matter (currently at 24kB of sprites). If this becomes a problem
in the future then context dependant spritesheets can be implemented. Things
like character sprites and bullet sprites should always be loaded since someone
may join the dungeon or whatever and the sprites will be need immediately.
Things like enemies and dungeon tiles can be loaded for the specific
portal/dungeon is accessed. In order to flush these out of browser memory the
img needs to have it's src set to a 1x1 pixel image or something and then be
removed from the DOM. The browser will decide when this 1x1 pixel gets removed
from memory but the larger spritesheet will be unloaded immediately.
