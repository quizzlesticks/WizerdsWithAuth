The map manager is responsible for drawing the floor and walls.

The map manager has the responsibility of calling the loads for the maps.
The maps themselves will draw their own loading screens.
The maps will then be called by the map managers draw function to determine
the tiles to draw.
The map managers draw is called by the game loop.
