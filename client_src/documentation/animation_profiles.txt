The animation profiles have the following layout

Basic:

ProfileNamespace: {
    AnimationName: {
        id: "Unique Identifier",
        sprite_width: width in pixels of a single sprite,
        sprite_height: height in pixels of a single sprite,
        sprite_columns: number of sprites in a row in grid,
        sprite_rows: number of sprite rows in grid,
        offset_x: specifies the x offset for the beginning of the sprite grid
        offset_y: specifies the y offset for the beginning of the sprite grid
        frame_delay: when drawnext is called we skip this many before actually doing it
        default_scale: scale to use if none is provided
        filename: where to find the spritesheet
        animation: [start, stop] coordinates are in 1d space of [sprite_row,sprite_column] tells what sprites to loop over

    }
}

A little more complex:

ProfileNamespace: {
    AnimationName: {
        id: "Unique Identifier",
        sprite_width: width in pixels of a single sprite,
        sprite_height: height in pixels of a single sprite,
        sprite_columns: number of sprites in a row in grid,
        sprite_rows: number of sprite rows in grid,
        offset_x: specifies the x offset for the beginning of the sprite grid
        offset_y: specifies the y offset for the beginning of the sprite grid
        frame_delay: when drawnext is called we skip this many before actually doing it
        default_scale: scale to use if none is provided
        filename: where to find the spritesheet
        animations: like animation except multiple key, value pairs with different animations, stored in object
    }
}

Real complex:

ProfileNamespace: {
    SuperAnimationName: {
        filename: lets you specify that every sprite should be pulled from the same spot, if used then filename in AnimationName is ignored
        AnimationName: {
            id: "Unique Identifier",
            sprite_width: width in pixels of a single sprite,
            sprite_height: height in pixels of a single sprite,
            sprite_columns: number of sprites in a row,
            sprite_rows: number of sprite rows,
            offset_x: specifies the x offset for the beginning of the sprite grid
            offset_y: specifies the y offset for the beginning of the sprite grid
            default_scale: scale to use if none is provided
            offset_x: specifies the x offset for the beginning of the sprite grid
            offset_y: specifies the y offset for the beginning of the sprite grid
            filename: where to find the spritesheet, allows unique sprite sheets even in group
            animations: like animation except multiple key, value pairs with different animations, stored in object
       }
       AnimationNameTwo: {
           id: "Unique Identifier",
           sprite_width: width in pixels of a single sprite,
           sprite_height: height in pixels of a single sprite,
           sprite_columns: number of sprites in a row,
           sprite_rows: number of sprite rows,
           offset_x: specifies the x offset for the beginning of the sprite grid
           offset_y: specifies the y offset for the beginning of the sprite grid
           frame_delay: when drawnext is called we skip this many before actually doing it
           default_scale: scale to use if none is provided
           filename: where to find the spritesheet, allows unique sprite sheets even in group
           animations: like animation except multiple key, value pairs with different animations, stored in object
      }
    AnimationNameOfNoneSuper: {
        id: ....
    }
}
